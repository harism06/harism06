## Hi there, I'm Haris ðŸ‘‹

Three things about me:
1. I love startups.
2. I love startups.
3. I love startups.

Oh yea, and I also just wanted to mention that I love startups.

Now instead of going on and on and on about how great I am, why I'm the best fit, and all that jazz, I just wanted to let you know how great YOU are for checking out my GitHub, so thank you.

Besides the occasional side projects, I try to write on here as well mostly inspired by Paul Graham so feel free to check that out if you're interested.
