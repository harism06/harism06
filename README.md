## Hi there, I'm Haris 👋

Three things about me:
1. I love startups.
2. I love startups.
3. I love startups.

Oh yea, and also just wanted to mention that I love startups.

Now instead of going on and on and on about how great I am, why I'm the best fit, and all that jazz, I just wanted to let you know how great you are for checking out my github, so thank you.
